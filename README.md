# Challenge-Evenly
An Android application that uses Foursquare's Places API to show nearby places.

Used Libraries:

- Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection
- Retrofit / OkHttp3 for network handling
- Glide for image retrieval

APIs

- Google Maps

Used clean architecture principles as much as possible with clear separation between presentation, domain, data layers.
